Web Scraping is used to extract data from websites into a structured format like a csv file which can be further used for analysis. Many tools like scrapy, pyspider and other SaaS based platforms are available for this purpose. This project uses requests, BeautifulSoup and pandas libraries from Python.

IMDB (The Internet Movie Database) is popularly browsed for movie reviews/ratings and other TV/celebrity content. The goal of this project is to code a python function for scraping the top movies for any given genre from IMDB with details such as movie name, IMDB URL, year of release, Duration, Genre, IMDB rating, Director, Star cast, number of votes.
